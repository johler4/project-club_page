                <p>Italian food is considered one of the best food palates in the world. It is full of flavor that will surely tantalize your taste buds which you will surely enjoy. Italian food culture uses distinct ingredients for all of their dishes such as tomato, eggplant, pasta, cured meats, and cheese. You must not forget about the sweet Italian desserts that will surely conclude your meal with a bang. The most important aspect that you must know about the Italian food culture is that their authentic dishes are only made with a few ingredients, and if the ingredient is not the freshest it can be, they will not buy it but substitute for better quality or not make the dish at all.</p>

                <h3 class="cuisine-type">Mexican</h3>
                <p>One of the world’s great cuisines, Mexican food is diverse, delicious, and profoundly omnivorous, both simple and sophisticated. Typical Mexican dishes are as basic as the ubiquitous quesadilla (a warm tortilla filled with melted cheese) or as elaborate as chicken served in mole negro (a Oaxacan sauce prepared with dozens of hand-ground ingredients). Food is essential to Mexican culture, and eating well is something enjoyed throughout Mexico, at every price point and in every type of establishment—from food stalls, bakeries, and markets to cafés, cantinas, and restaurants.</p>

                <h3 class="cuisine-type">American</h3>
                <p>The U.S. is a melting pot of cultures as a result of the many immigrants and enslaved people that came here from various other countries across the globe. A significant part of this equation, too, comes from the cultures of Indigenous peoples who lived on the land well before colonization. With this bountiful combination of culinary traditions, American cuisine has become greater than the sum of its parts and offers something unique. This country has established several dishes that many consider examples of an "American" food tradition.</p>

                <p>Asian cooking is one of the famous cuisines globally patronised, and for many reasons. Every Asian dish is cooked in various ways and features different flavours that leave a mark on people. Every dish is cooked using a wide array of spices and condiments that helps bring out a distinct flavour. And the food has common ingredients, such as rice, garlic, onions, soy sauce, seafood, etc., cooked in different ways. While the dishes have the same components, the taste becomes different when it's stir-fried, deep-fried, and steamed.</p>

                <p>We at The Cooking Club are just a bunch of normal girls and guys who enjoy cooking and spending time with others. We get together on a monthly basis to prepare, cook, and enjoy food from various cultures while also enjoying the company of each other. We know that time spent with others is not always an easy task to do, but we understand that it is essential.

                <p>Each event has three courses, each prepared by different members of the group; an appetizer, a main dish and a dessert. The way we decide on what type of cuisine to prepare is by voting at the end of the previous event. One random person is put in charge and gets to decide on what each course is going to be. At each event we divide into three groups of coordinate with eachother on preparing the dishes.</p>
